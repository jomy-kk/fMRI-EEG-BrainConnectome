For a metric, creates a file given a visualization template.

The chosen metric may be one of the following:
* 'Betweenness Unweighted'
* 'Betweenness Weighted'
* 'Degree'
* 'Strength'
* 'PC'
* 'wMD'
* 'RichClubDegCoeff'

I.e., any node-level metric. 
The resulting file can then be used in ** to visualize the nodes, with size based on the chosen metric.
